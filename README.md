# How to use
Import it into your library or analyzer, and get champion information super quick.

This library should not be used for Cheating even though the name of the program is CheatSharp

It may be renamed at any time, because that is a dang misleading name for an analyzer.

This program intends to try and analyze previous games (replays) and tells you how to improve (drawing on screen) and showing mistakes. It intends to be almost like Cheats but valid as it doesn't affect any gameplay (only post gameplay).

In some cases CheatSharp will determine an EndOfGame point where it predicts the chances of winning are very low. If this occurs CheatSharp will print EndOfGame detected: Blue/Red Team Win. This is when a game is at a point where the enemy has a very high lead and the only chance of winning is from an ememy throw.
